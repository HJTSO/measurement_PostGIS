首先，我们看看他的肌肉。 

111
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:10,240
This reminds me of Super Saiyan in Dragon Ball.
想起了龙珠里超级赛亚人。 

112
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:25,860
Now we are checking his body fat and lean body mass with this special equipment.
现在，我们用这个特殊的设备检查他的体脂肪率和除脂肪体重。 

113
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,200
OK done with measuring, so pls come out.
好了，测量完成，请出来。 

114
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:39,480
Just a second till we get the result.
结果等一下出来，请稍等一下。 

115
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,259
The result says your body fat is 4.5%. Is this same as always?
结果显示你体内的脂肪为4.5％。这是跟往常一样吗？ 

116
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:48,620
I don't know exactly. I thought my body fat is around 10%.
事实上我不太清楚。我想我的身体脂肪应该是10％左右。 

117
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,179
Oh really?
真的吗？ 

118
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:58,980
This time with this equipment, your body fat is 4.5% and lean body mass is 75.144kg.
这一次，这个设备，你体脂肪率为4.5％，除脂肪体重是75.144千克。 

119
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:10,119
Nevertheless he is not at the period of losing weight at this moment, his body fat is as same as the top body builder's one.
不过他没有在这时段减肥，他的身体脂肪和顶级健美运动员一样的程度。 

120
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:22,079
We measured the thickness of muscles one by one to see which muscles are developed well.
我们一个一个地测量肌肉的厚度，看哪个肌肉发达。 

121
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,279
Your muscle is developed very well.
你的肌肉发育得很好。 

122
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,519
I can see the pump.
我可以看到泵样器官。 

123
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,400
Yes pumped
是的，泵样器官

124
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:38,819
By the result, even though he is not big, his muscles are developed to the limit of his body frame.
从该结果，尽管他并不很壮大，但他的肌肉发达到了身体的极限。 

125
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:47,519
Takanori Ishii, Prof. in Ryoutokuji Univ. says His class is 77kg class but he has as same muscle amounts as 81 to 90 kg class player have.
了德寺大学的石井孝法教授说，他是77公斤级，但他有81到90公斤级的选手同样的肌肉量。 

126
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:56,779
His whole body muscles are big. Moreover, the parts of muscles for using his techniques at judo are especially developed.
他全身的肌肉都大。此外，他在柔道方面运用技巧的肌肉特别发达。 

127
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:06,140
Red parts are the places where are more developed than the muscles of same weight class players.
红色是比相同重量等级运动员的肌肉更发达的部分。 

128
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:13,299
Erector spinae muscles, which works for standing straight at the grappling with each other.
竖脊肌，它用于在相互摔斗中保持站立。 

129
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,019
The right Abdominal external oblique muscles
右腹部外斜肌

130
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,920
And right hamstring
还有，右大腿肌

131
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:32,440
These three parts are the key muscles of Ono's Judo.
这三个部分是大野柔道的主要肌肉。 

132
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:41,119
The right Abdominal external oblique muscles are used when Ono tries to stay still or control the opponent in a grappling postion.
右腹外斜肌可以让大野保持稳住静止，或正位控制对手。 

133
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:55,279
The right hamstring is for the kick of Uchimata or Osoto-gari to jump them up or turn them down.
右大腿肌的作用于用大外刈或者是内股的踢跳摔倒对方。 

134
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:04,180
To win Judo in limited weight, technique, style and  strength must be balanced at the high level.
为了在有限的重量，技术，风格和实力胜利，柔道必须在高层次进行平衡。 

135
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:12,220
I think his body is balanced well to the limit.
我认为他的身体平衡到了极限。 

136
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:23,500
And further measurement shows us that Ono has his original skills to compete with big guys.
进一步的测量显示，大野有着与大选手竞争的独到技能。 

137
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:34,480
Capturing the markers on Ono's body, we can see the directions of techniques and the change of speed.
捕获的大野身上的标志，我们可以看到做动作时方向和速度的变化。 

138
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,359
We focused on the momentums of his rotating.
注意于他旋转的势头。 

139
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:50,640
We did analyze how fast the both of Ono and the partner who is thrown rotates.
看看大野和他的搭档旋转的速度有多快。 

140
00:19:50,640 --> 00:20:00,140
Ono spins his body very widely with his leg raised before starting Uchimata.
当大野做內股的动作之前，身体和腿的移动幅度很大。 

141
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:09,779
Once Ono throws by Uchimata, the partner is thrown rapidly with a big circular motion.
当大野使用內股，对手就马上大圈被抛出。 

142
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:20,259
These graphs indicates the momentums. Blue is for Ono, Red is for the partner thrown.
这些图表显示动量。蓝色是大野，红色是抛出的对手。 

143
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:30,059
Ono is swinging his left leg widely to rotate and Blue line is going up. We can see the momentum is raised.
大野把他的左腿摆的幅度很大，旋转起来，蓝线在上升。我们可以看到势头（动量）正在增强。 

144
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:36,859
As soon as Ono throw, the partner's Red line is rising suddenly.
当大野一摔，对方的红线突然上升。。 

145
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:46,740
This tells us that the huge momentum of Ono was transmitted to the partner's body in a second and the partner was thrown at an incredible rate.
这告诉我们，大野的巨大动量在一秒钟内传递给对手，使对手以很快的速度被摔出。 

146
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:55,319
In comparison to a top ranked judo player in 81kg class which one class heavier,
跟一位比较顶尖的81公斤级较重的柔道选手比较， 

147
00:20:55,319 --> 00:21:00,960
There is a remarkable difference between them. That is the Red line which indicates the momentum of body thrown.
两者之间存在显着差异。红线表示投掷身体的动量。 

148
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:13,839
Ono is in one class lighter, but he can throw more explosively than the 88kg guy.
虽然大野是较轻，但他可以抛出时比88公斤级选手更有爆发力。 

149
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,359
First, he produces the momentum by rotating the body with swinging his left leg widely.
首先，他通过摆动左腿来旋转身体来产生动力。 

150
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:24,900
Second, he transmits the momentum to the opponent with great precision.
其次，他以极高的精准度向对手传递动量。 

151
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:38,759
By doing these 2 complicating movements precisely, small Ono creates the explosive power.
通过精确地完成这2个复杂的动作，大野有了大爆炸力。 

152
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:46,500
Prof. Ishii says" In real matches, Ono will try to make bigger momentum within his body and try to transmit it to the opponent."
石井教授说：“在真正的比赛中，会使更大的动量并传递给对方。” 

153
00:21:46,500 --> 00:22:01,380
Considering this Ono's momentum in lab, I definitely can tell that Ono can create extremely huge power in real matches and the opponents try no to be thrown but they can't stand up. Literally, they are blown away."
根据大野在实验室里的冲力，我可以肯定地说，大野可以在真正比赛中使出巨大力量，即使对手想防御，他们也站不稳。真像被被吹倒了一样。” 

154
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:12,519
Here are the trainings he does to maximize the power of techniques.
这是他为最大限度发挥技术力量所做的训练。 

155
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,480
At here, pedal harder. Harder, you can do it more!!  Much harder! Good, you did it.
在这里，用力踩踏板。再努力，你可以做得更多！更努力！很好，你做到了。 

156
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:34,279
He trains like these everyday. This is the reason why Ono can throw heavyweight players
他每天都这样训练。这就是为什么大野可以投重量级选手的原因

157
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,980
Ono started Judo at 7 years old.
大野在7岁开始柔道。 

158
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:44,579
2 years elder brother influenced him.
因为大两岁的哥哥对他的影响。 

159
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:50,000
Here is the man who taught Ono to fight fare and square.
这是教大野在赛场上比赛的人。 

160
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,440
His name is Haruya Mochida. He is Ono's former teacher in junior and senior high school.
他叫持田治也。他是大野中学高校时期的教练。 

161
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,740
This brings back memories.
真让人怀念。 

162
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:11,220
Ono did learn and train at the boarding school, Kodogakusha, where 2 gold medalists Koga and Yoshida learn too.
大野学习并且寄宿学校-讲道学舍，这里出了其中2位金牌得主古贺和吉田。 

163
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:19,759
But first, Ono was a normal and discreet player.
但首先，大野是一个正常和谨慎的选手。 

164
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,160
Well  he was bit thin. That was what I thought.
嗯，我觉得他是有点瘦。 

165
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:35,920
In fact, he was probably second or third to last when entering exam match.
事实上，他在参加考试时可能是第二名或第三名 

166
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:46,400
Osoto-gari is the first technique he taught to Ono. To do Osoto-gari,  we need to grab the opponent tightly with both hands.
大外刈是他教给大野第一个技发。要做到大外刈，需要用双手紧紧地抓住对手。 

167
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,940
Carelessly doing Osoto-gari, you never throw them or even they would have a chance to throw you back.
漫不经心地做大外刈，你不仅不会摔倒对方，他们反而有机会摔倒你。 

168
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:57,640
So we must step forward without fear.
因此，我们必须挺身而出，无所畏惧。 

169
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:06,960
Mochida told Ono again and again " Step forward. Push forward. Do not think if opponent would throw you back or not."
持田一再告诉大野“向前一步。推进。不要考虑如果对手会把你摔倒。” 

170
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,539
He told me only one thing "Push forward intently. Once the opponent step back, throw him by  Osoto-gari." He kept saying to me again and again.
他告诉我：“向前推进。一旦对手退一步，通过大外刈把他摔倒”。他一次又一次地对我说。 

171
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:23,700
I think the moment was my turning point of Judo.
我认为这是我练柔道的转折点。 

172
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:38,119
As Ono tried to throw big players by Osoto-gari again and again even though he was thrown back many times,  his style " grab well and throw" was established.
当大野不断地用大外刈摔倒大对手，即使他自己也被投倒多次，慢慢形成他的“抢位后摔”的风格。 

173
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:46,740
He believes the way he trusts once. He never quit till it accomplished.
他一旦想做一件事的话就会坚信到底。直到完成之前不会放弃。 

174
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,099
He did not care how many times he was thrown back. He ain't pessimistic. He did not think that this technique is not good for him.
他不在乎被摔了多少次。他不悲观。他不会去先想这个技术好不好。 

175
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:58,859
He got to the place where he believes " OK, I will do the way. This is my style."
（练习时）到了他认为的点，就会确定自己的风格。” 

176
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:06,160
After entering Tenri Univ, he did not quit polishing the technique and kept the teaching of Mochida.
进入天理大学后，他并没有停止柔道技术，继续保持持田的教学训练。 

177
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,819
When he was 4th year student in the university, he won the gold medal at World Judo tournament 2013.
当他4年的大学期间，他赢得了2013世界柔道锦标赛的金牌。 

178
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:16,400
His style of Judo " grab well and throw" was about to be completed.
他的“抢位后摔”柔道风格差不多形成。 

179
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:29,079
I have trained so many years till I could say this technique is my favorite one. 
我训练了这么多年，目前为止有自己的得意技术。

180
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:39,299
Because of this, if there is a genius, of course I am not, even the genius never could make this happen in just one day. He or she might also need time to make one thing good enough. So I need more time.
即使是天才永远无法做到在短短的一天做到。（所以我需要更多的时间训练） 

181
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,299
March, Osaka
三月，大阪

182
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:45,980
2 months out from All Japan Judo Tournament
离全日本柔道锦标赛前2个月

183
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:58,700
He visited the person who he wanted to meet before.
他拜访了他想认识的人 

184
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:05,779
Here is a training camp for spring sumo wrestling tournament of Isegahama Sumo Gym.
这是伊勢ケ濱部屋相扑体育馆春季比赛训练营。 

185
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:06,880

早上好！！ 

186
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,640

His name is Harumafuji. He is from Mongolia and one of 4 Yokozuna,  Grand Champions of Sumo wrestling.
他的名字是日馬富士。他来自蒙古，4个横纲之一，相扑大冠军。。(横纲：日本相扑选手资格的最高级，同时期在役的横纲通常不会超过四个) 

188
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,400
Sumo wrestling is open-weight martial art.
相扑是无重量级的武术。 

189
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,220
Among the top-division wrestlers, he is one of the lightest wrestlers.
在顶级摔跤手中，他是最轻的摔跤手之一。 

190
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:42,119
He did climb to the top of Sumo wrestling world by fighting fare and square against bigger Sumo wrestlers.
他跟大的相扑选手相扑搏斗，登上了相扑世界的顶峰。 

191
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:51,839
How did he reach the highest place?
他是如何做到这些？ 

192
00:26:51,839 --> 00:27:32,819
Ono realized Harumafuji has special movements which compensate his small body.
首先，小野注意到日馬富士有用特别的移动来弥补身体的不足。 

193
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:42,339
I am very impressed by your speed of the initial charge. It is very different from other wrestlers.
你最初的启动速度给我留下了很深的印象。其他摔跤运动员有很大的不同。（非常快） 

194
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:46,440
Everyday I do train myself with checking my movement one by one.
一个一个地检查自己的训练动作。 

195
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:54,359
Ono asked Harumafuji " What is the key when you fight with big guys?"
大野问日馬富士：“当你与大选手比赛，秘诀是什么？” 

196
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,400
As you know, there is an old saying in Judo " Shin, Gi, Tai, or Mind, Skill and Body"
如你所知，柔道有“心技体” 

197
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,819
We do have the same in Sumo " Mind, Skill and Body"
相扑一样有“心技体” 

198
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:04,640
I also think Mind is the first key.
我觉得“心”是第一个关键 

199
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,279
There are many injuries all over my body right now. but I can keep wrestling with everyone's supports. It makes me strong.
到大家的支持（让我坚强），最近在“心”里学习到相扑 

200
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,759
Truly now I am supported by so many people.
诚然，受到这么多人的支持。 

201
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,380
Mind exceeds Skill and Body.
心的境界比技能和身体更重要。 

202
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,019
That is the answer of Harumafuji.
这就是日馬富士的答案。 

203
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:33,039
I am trying to be strong at heart or mind. So I never think that I am light.
我尝试在心理或精神得到增强。我从来不认为自己厉害。 

204
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,380
This is all.
这就是全部。 

205
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:44,980
Mind is the key. Mind compensates Skill and Body. If I believe I have power enough to beat other, I have already for sure.
心是关键。心可以让技术和身体得到补偿。如果我相信自己有能力击败对手，就胜券在握了 

206
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,359
To challenge with Mind makes me stronger than bigger players.
用心去比赛让我比大选手更强大 

207
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,099
Thank you very much for having me.
非常感谢您邀请我。
